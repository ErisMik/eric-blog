Today we went to Fat Mao for Lunch! I found it on some online list
of places to go have food and it looked good. The drive to Chinatown
was very busy, it's Saturday so the traffic is bad in Vancouver, as usual.
We passed by another restaurant I was thinking of going, Ramen Butcher, but
Fat Mao was right next to it and it looked cute. 

"Did you know that Mao (è²“) means Cat?" - Jazzy

I got the braised duck soup with the wide noodles and Jazzy got the 
hot and sour pork soup with the rice sheets. THe food didn't take
too long to come to us, but Jazzy remarked that "By Hong Kong fast
food standards this is a LONG time" :P . When it did arrive the
food looked really good! I REALLY liked my soup and noodles! Jazzy 
wasn't so fond of hers but she said it was still good! Another
great lunch for the beans!

Afterwards we went to Brown Paper Packages Ice Cream for an after
dinner treat. We ate our ice cream as we strolled through
Dr. Sun Yat Sen park and through Chinatown.

I wonderful saturday date with Jasmine!
