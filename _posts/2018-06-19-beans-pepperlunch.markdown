For out dinner we decided to go to Pepper Lunch! I had never been but it looked fun!
It was really good! It was a super hot day so getting a really hot meal didn't seem too appealing.
Luckily the place was very well air conditioned and the water was very cold haha!

I got the curry beef and Jazzy got the classic beef, it was REALLY good! I would go back any day!
It's really fun to just make your own food in front of you!

Afterwards we went to Whole Foods and tried their new frozen Mochi things! I didn't realize they
had ice cream in them so imagine my surprise!!! I liked the salted caramel one the best and Jazzy agrees
with me!

Overall a fantastic evening with the smol bean <3
