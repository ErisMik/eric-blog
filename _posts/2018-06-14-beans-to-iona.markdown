It was a particularly nice evening so we decided to go for a walk and view the sunset.
I took Jazzy down to iona beach regional park down in Richmond. I wanted to bike down
there with her one day but I was running out of time with her this summer so I did it
anyways.

It was an amazingly warm day, and the sky was clear, but with enough clouds to make
the sunset worthwhile. As the sun was slowly dipping below the horizon we did a
photoshoot in the golden light. Jazzy looked absolutely fantastic, breathtaking even.

We sat and as the sun set, we waxed nostalgic about how far we've come, the embarrassing
stories of when we first met, and just about life in general. Eventually the conversation 
turned a lot more serious and delicate, but by then end I was more sure of my love for 
the Smol Bean then when we started.
