This weekend we decided to go camping! 
We packed up all the stuff on Thursday and started the long drive over to [Wells Gray Provincial Park](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/wells_gry/) , Clearwater River Campground

It was a long drive, about 7 hours in total, but it just flew by! Sadly the clouds and rain kept the most majestic views out of sight.

It was spitting rain when we got there, and luckily the downpour didn't start until after we had set everything up.
We got the tent all cozy, then decided to eat. Jazzy prepped some corn while I got the fire started!

I tried to teach Jazzy how to chop the wood, and she eventually figured it out! We grilled some beef patties and the corn on the flames, then grilled up some s'mores. We were stuffed afterwards!!

We hung out in the tent afterwards and listened to the rain come down all over our tent as we fell asleep. It was cozy and warm in the sleeping bag next to Jazzy <3.

The next day we woke up early, and just stayed all nice and cozy inside the tent till the rain calmed down. 
The double layered bed we made was nice because it kept us safe from the water that was pooling at the bottom of the tent!

We eventually got up and made breakfast: Noodles, bacon and eggs, mmm tasty!

Deciding to go back early, we got lucky with a huge break in the rain as we packed up. Shoutout to Jazzy for packing up everything that was inside the tent!

On the way back we made a few stops: First was Clearwater Lake, the lake was so large and peaceful, and in the distance you could see the clouds wisping through the trees, it was magical.
We also stopped for a short hike to a waterfall! The falls itself weren't too impressive but there was a massive amount of water pouring through! I helped Jazzy down to the viewpoint and a did my normal waterfall ritual. Afterwards, the trail to the falls left us "shook" :P

On the way back we stopped at an adorable little German restaurant and I discovered a new love for "Currywurst", bratwurst covered in a curry ketchup! Damn good!

The drive back was nice and peaceful, a great end to this little "Misadventure". Looking forward to the next adventure with the beans!
