After dinner at Pepper Lunch we decided to hike down to the beach to watch the sunset.
We got off at Alma and walked the few blocks to Jericho beach. Being that neither
of us were particularly prepared to go to the beach, we took off or shoes and socks
and shirts and sat down on a log to enjoy the view.

We talked about the future and about us and just soaked in these precious hours that we
have before we part ways for the rest of the summer.

We played in water and did another photoshoot in the golden light. Jazzy looked as great
as she always does. Somehow I even found the self confidence to take my shirt off for
a bit!

It was another wonderful evening spent with Jazzy, here's to many many more in
the future!
